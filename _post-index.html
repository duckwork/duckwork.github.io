            <h1>About me</h1>

            <p>A little about me: I've just moved to Baton Rouge a few months
                ago, I'm working at the catering company for LSU football games
                (which is quite the trip, let me tell you), I'm doing an
                online-working thing, which is quite new to me, and I'm working
                for the capital city's NPR station, WRKF, which is what I
                really like.  All of these ch-ch-ch-changes in my life bring me
                to this, which is a super-lightweight blog (I don't even have
                styles yet!) to write whatever I want.</p>

            <p>If you don't like it, you can leave, or comment on the site by
                sending me an <a href="mailto:casedizz@gmail.com" title="I
                    swear to god, if you spam me, I will go Liam Neeson on your
                    ass.">email</a>.  I also welcome comments.</p>
