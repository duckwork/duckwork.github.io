How many of us can say that we truly know ourselves? Know anyone else? Know
anything even?

Whatever. I'm using this page as my own little internet tiny-house, to
practice my writing, which is sadly fallen by the wayside recently. So here we
are.

About me: I'm from Dolly Parton's hometown (we have a statue on the courthouse
lawn!), and I always wanted to get away until I did. Through fits and starts
I've arrived in Baton Rouge, and I miss the mountains (though, surprisingly, I
don't mind the heat). I get paid to read books to children. I'm happy with
that.

I'm also the progenitor / sole remaining member (as far as I know) of [Loose
Poops](https://loosepoops.github.io), an art collective. [JOIN
US](mailto:mahataman2@gmail.com) for funzos, if you want.

# Colophon

This site is generated on [Github pages][] using [Jekyll][].  The color theme
is based loosely off of the [acme][] editor's.  The font that *I* see (because
I have it installed) is CMU Typewriter Text Variable Width, which is bundled
with [TeX][],[^1] but you probably see Georgia or some serif font, because I'm
lazy and don't want to bother embedding the fonts.  I compose my posts in
[Vim][] installed on a laptop powered by [Gentoo][].  I use the [awesome][]
window manager if you care about that.  I'm trying as well as I can to use
free software where possible.  I should probably write a post about my ideas
around intellectual property, etc., but for now, I'm just living them.

[^1]: I think, anyway.  I don't know; I have the font installed and I know that the CMU fonts have come from TeX in other distros I've used.  I'm pretty sure that if you follow TeX you'll get the font, if you're looking for it; at any rate TeX is great software so there's that.
