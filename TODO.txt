- Pandoc
    - fix 'blockquote styled as aside' hack.  This could be done a few ways:
        - put the asides in 'fenced code blocks' with {.aside} class, then 
          transform 'Code' blocks to 'Div's with class 'aside' (which in HTML
          would be written as <aside>, maybe).
        - fix the CSS to only work on blockquotes that are ':first-child',
          though that's brittle.
- Publishing
    - at some point, the year will flip over.  I need to figure out what to do
      about having different years in my blog entries.
    - include some better form of navigation?  like a side nav that turns to
      a top nav on a media query?  and maybe a few other options when it comes
      to categories or sections of the blog.
- Sections
    - resume / cv
        - it'd be really great if it was dynamic in some way, like you could
          view the whole thing or just stuff that you want, like Tech jobs or
          Writing jobs or Assistance jobs or something. 
    - wishlists / reading lists
        - could just be organized better or easier to *do*; like by using
          pandoc to compile easier-edited text files to HTML.
            - the problem here of course is getting titles and authors styled
              right while keeping it easy to maintain in the text source.
