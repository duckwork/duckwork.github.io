I cook a lot.  I like to cook.
You might say that I am hooked.
When I cook, I'll post about
the food I decide to try out.
Like my [readlist](/readlist), I'll put stuff here
to try, and link them when I'm clear
on each one's strengths and it's weakness
and if I made a great big mess.

- Khichuri ([via NPR][khichuri])
- Vegan bolognese
