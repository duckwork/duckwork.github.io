I love comic books.  I love how they're able to live in that space between books and cinema: they're as visually stimulating as a film, but as portable and seekable as a book.  You can feel the amount of time put into them, the love labored out over inking, coloring, writing.  They're great.

The best thing about them is they can be consumed very quickly.  In fact, I read comic books so fast I almost disappoint myself; I feel like I should take more time with them, savor the images and stories.  Maybe I should read them more than once.

I haven't read Natalie Riess's *Space Battle Lunchtime* (volume 1) more than once, though now that I'm thinking about it I might go for it again tonight.  I just finished *Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom*, after all.  At any rate, what I'll write now will be first thoughts.

*Space Battle Lunchtime* is a lot of fun.  It's a play on Food Network shows like *Chopped* or *MasterChef*, but in SPACE!  And with ALIENS!  And kidnapping and murder thrown in!  It follows an Earthling baker, Peony, who's cast to the eponymous intergalactic hit cooking contest show after one of the contestants drops out suddenly.  I thought there'd be some, "Oh look, we're in space!  It's so strange/interesting/post-scarcity/complicatedly political" expository stuff at the beginning, but it turns out not to be the case.  Peony's thrown into production along with us and the show gets going.

The copy I read was the first 4 issues of the comic book bound together.  In it, the show goes through your standard cooking-competition elimination rounds while hinting at a darker underbelly to the competition.  One of the chefs, Melonhead, is back from a devastating loss last year, and let's just say he wants that title.  Between him and the other alien chefs, the ingredients, and the setting, the comic book is beautifully drawn, as well.  I really like the style, which to my mind is something like *Steven Universe* or other modern cartoons -- clean lines, bright colors, a little anime influence.

I think I'll have to re-read this book when I get home to tide me over til I can find the next one.  It ends when the action is just getting interesting.
