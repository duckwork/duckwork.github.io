# method

## filling

Pierce the **sweet potato** several times with a fork; place on a foil-lined
baking sheet; bake 50--60 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork.  If
pressed for time, microwave it for 6 minutes on high.

Let the sweet potato cool slightly, then peel and add to a food processor.
Add the **chipotle**, **garlic**, **lime juice**, **honey**, **olive oil** and
**tahini** and process until smooth.  Thin with up to **2 T of water** if
necessary to make the mixture smooth and spreadable.

While the potatoes are roasting, roast the **poblanos** over an open flame on
high heat, turning frequently until they're charred all over.  Place the
peppers in a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap, which allows the steam to
loosen the skins.  Peel the peppers, remove the seeds and thinly slice them
into strips.

Heat one tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Peel and cut
the **onion** into thin slices, like the poblanos; add both to the skillet and
cook them for 8--10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the onions are soft.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.

## assembly

Heat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat.  Spread about 1/2 cup of the
sweet potato mixture over a tortilla and add a layer of the onion/pepper
mixture.  Top the tortilla with another and add it to the grill, and cook it
like a quesadilla.  You know how.

# review

Holy crap, the filling in this dillas are amazing.  The adobo chilis are like
nothing I've ever tasted before, except maybe in my dreams: it's smoky, sweet,
and spicy, and I want to put it on literally everything.  The meal is also
filling without having any cheese -- I love it so much I don't even really
want to call them *quesa*dillas, since I feel like that makes them feel like
they're missing something -- which they ain't.  Maybe just *dillas*?  Anyway,
they're amazing.  Recipe from Buzzfeed, but really from
