I'm in that interstitial space between books, a no-book on 
the other side of two covers.  I just finished reading *The 
City and the City* (Miéville), in which interstice is a 
character: the novel is about two city-states that share the 
same geography (are *topogangers*, one of Miéville's 
wonderful neologisms to describe the political,  
bureaucratic, and geographical nature of the cities), where 
breaching the borders between the two is an existential 
crime. The book itself is a gripping murder mystery that 
uses its setting almost as another character, and the 
setting pulled me in completely. As I was reading it, I 
began to feel paranoid even in my normal life, worried that 
some unseen presence underneath or between what I 
could see was watching me, waiting for something.
I also began to notice interstices around me: the ways in 
which I (I hope *we*) unsee those around us on the street, 
deciding we don't know them; the places that are 
unnoticeable because they are nowhere, but between two 
others; those times when we're getting ready for 
something or finishing something else, and really aren't 
doing much of anything, but are truly living. Yesterday, it 
was raining very hard for about an hour and I went out the 
back door of the office, to an interstice between our 
building and the house next door. There was an unused 
loading dock there, and a mysterious motor of some kind, I 
guess a wench or something like it. I was in the middle of 
a city but I felt as though I were on another planet, maybe 
in that planet of a short story (I don't remember the name 
or who wrote it, only this) where it had rained for 
hundreds of years, constantly. I was nowhere; I felt free.
Or whatever. I mean, I did in that moment, but it's pretty 
ridiculous looking at it that way now. Or is what I'm doing 
now, discounting the experience, a normalization of an 
experienced moment of interstice? Some sublime 
unknowable thing that exists nowhere and everywhere at 
once? I don't know. I have no organized thoughts. If 
they're organized, if I put them into buildings, won't I have 
dark alleys between them where anything can happen?

# Anyway

I can't think of a good way to segue into this, but I'm in 
another interstice now as well. I ordered like 6 (just 
counted -- it's 6) books from the library and I've just 
finished reading all of them (except for *The Resilient 
Gardener*, which is more of a how-to for the apocalypse 
and really dry), so I'm not only between books, but 
between sets of books. I'm going to start *Atlas Shrugged* 
today, but first I want to talk about these books I've just 
read, so here they are, all at once:

## *Even in Paradise*, Elizabeth Nunez

Nunez's novel is a modern, post-colonial take on *King 
Lear*, and it was decent (I thought the ending was a little 
where-are-they-now, end-of-documentary summation, and 
the writing style was, I don't remember, but something 
was a little off, okay?), but it really made me remember my 
whole thing with the *King Lear* story. First off, *King 
Lear* is *not* the first iteration of that tale; like many 
Shakespearean plays, its roots are much older, and a story 
very much like it is told [all over the world][salts]. The first 
place I heard it was in *Grandfather Tales*, a collection of 
Appalachian folk tales, where the youngest daughter, 
instead of saying she loves her father as much as is her 
duty, tells him she loves him "As much as meat loves salt." 
I was thinking about the differences between the two, 
between duty and salt, and I think I like the second better 
because I don't like the power-dynamic implications of 
words like *duty*, especially in regards to the 
machinations of love. Love should be freely given, and 
accepted as a gift: if someone loves only to fulfill some 
duty, that is not love, but loyalty. Which is not to say 
loyalty is trash, of course! But it isn't love, and I'm not a 
fan of the idea that love is a thing that can be demanded 
as fealty. However, the *salt* thing I like, because as the 
story bears out, without salt, meat is nothing, 
meaningless; life without love is the same. Plus it's a cool 
metaphor.

## *Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom*, Cory Doctorow

A fun little jaunt into what happens when nothing is 
scarce anymore: it's the near future, and death has been 
cured, as well as all scarcity. Instead of currency, people 
trade in Whuffie, which is basically esteem of everyone 
around. Doctorow shows us the joys of transhumanism, 
computer-brains, and post-scarcity economics, but he also 
shows us the existential angst that can go along with it. 
His main argument, it seems to me, is that we need 
something to work toward or against, so if a natural 
opponent is taken away, we'll make them ourselves. It was 
a fun book, and funny, but it didn't make me think 
anything Big.

## *Cinderella Ate My Daughter*, Peggy Orenstein

Orenstein has a pedigree writing about womens' liberation 
issues for publications like the *New York Times*, or 
whatever has a lot of caché nowadays. That sounds like I 
think it's dumb -- I don't, promise; I'm just pumping these 
reviews out so blehgh. Anyway, this book made me even 
more afraid to have children than I already was! It made 
me realize that no matter what values I might try to instill 
in a daughter or a son, like Orenstein, I will fail to protect 
them from a classist, sexist, consumerist world that 
constantly bombards them with its messaging: "BUY 
MORE SHIT!" "BE THIS WAY!" "DON'T DO THAT!" "YOU 
ARE THIS, NOT THAT!" "GOOD IS NARROW!" etc. I think 
it's good books like this are here, though, because they're 
the only way to slowly, slowly push the prow back in the 
right direction, to sail onwards toward that ever-receding 
horizon and the rising sun.

# Okay

That's it for now. BOOF
