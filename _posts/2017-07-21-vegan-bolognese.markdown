# review

This recipe's always a hit -- I've made it many times, for holidays, dinners, everything, and it's always met with "YUM"s.
Sometimes I put diced canned tomatoes instead of crushed, and it also works.
Oh, and last night I had no thyme so I used some Herbs de Provence, which also was great.
This recipe got me started on my saga of sauces that I'm still following.
I learned a lot making this dish, and I feel kind of bad because I don't even know where it came from.
But I'm sure that whoever came up with it is in pasta heaven, so they're doing okay.
