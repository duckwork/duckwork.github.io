It's funny -- as I was cleaning up my [Readlist][], removing things that had
been on my Amazon wishlist that I'd already read, I noticed that *Instructions
to the Cook: A Zen Master's Lessons in Living a Life that Matters* (Glassman &
Fields) was included.  It was funny to me because I forgot that was on my
list, and checked it out from the library a few weeks ago on a whim
regardless.  Like, I guess I'm interested in Zen and cooking, right?

Anyway, the book was terrible.  I ended up reading maybe 20 pages of it and
returning it because Glassman seemed to only talk about how much *he* had
gotten out of his Zen practice, not actually *how* to practice or what to do.
It seemed really egoistic, so I just put it down.  And there's my first
review.
