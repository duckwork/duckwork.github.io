# First things first (or fourth, or ...)

This is probably the fifth or sixth time I've tried starting some sort of
blog.  When my first girlfriend broke up with me, I word-puked all over some
startup's Dropbox-linked minimal thing, but once that was done, it was done
(and I'm not even sure if the host would still be there even if I remembered
what it was).  I put my [Master's thesis online][masters],[^1] sort of like a
blog, if you're willing to call something that is totally not a blog a blog
(hey, I'm trying to self-promote here, though really I think the biggest thing
that keeps me from writing is the constant editor in my head whispering
*readers, readers* so that I can't do anything but think of that other person,
the possible future reader, and what they'll think of me).  At some point last
year I tried (on this [Github repo][gh] even!) to do some kind of "Failure
blog" inspired by Baton Rouge's first annual [Failure Fest][], but eventually
I burnt out on that too (shocking).

But I'm really going to try this time.  I've decided I'm done with thinking
about a reader, or posturing like I don't care, or whatever it is I've been
doing that means I'm not writing.  That's what I want to do; it's what I'll
do.  I'm also going to edit my own writing.

So there you have it: first of all, this blog is a practice for my writing and
an outlet for talking about the stuff I read or watch or listen to or
experience.

# My name is Case

I'm a writer by training and a reader by trade.  I get to read books to small
children for a living, which is as fulfilling as I thought it'd be.  Honestly
the hardest part is figuring out which books are best for a big group: just
today I tried _I'm My Own Dog_ by [David Ezra Stein][] and it did not work.
The humor was lost on a big group of twenty, and kids to boot.

Anyway, I've been journaling for a bit and now wanted to take it to *the next
level*, which in 2017 is online.  So here I am.  Online.
