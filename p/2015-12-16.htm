  <h1>It&#8217;s been altogether too long<a href="#too-long" class="anchor">#</a></h1>
  <h2 class="date">12/16</h2>

  <p>It&#8217;s been ten days since my last entry here. I&#8217;ve been busy, sure, but not that busy. And I have no excuse. I changed the color scheme though!</p>
  <h3 id="anyway-an-update">Anyway, an update</h3>
  <p>My new job has been going well. I&#8217;m not doing a tontonton yet, but I&#8217;m picking things up and my boss likes me, so that&#8217;s good. The pacing is interesting&#8212;it&#8217;s like a short-order kitchen for paper products.</p>
  <p>Also Rachel is well, though today she&#8217;s been working on grading which is the WORST and a big reason I skipped out on the whole teaching gig. Those few days every six months are un-get-backable. AND my old job had an Xmas party, which was a good time (too good of a time).</p>
  <h3 id="but-thats-not-the-thing">But that&#8217;s not the thing</h3>
  <p>The thing is from today. The thing is a failure.</p>
  <p>I have worn through the ass of all of my pants but two pair, and one of those has a big stain. So I have one functioning pair of pants right now. Tonight, I went to the Mall to get another pair of pants.</p>
  <p>I utterly failed. I left, two and a half hours later, pantsless. I don&#8217;t blame it completely on myself: I&#8217;m a 30-34 with literally 0 ass, so not a lot of stores carry pants that&#8217;ll work on me. I know because I checked. Every store.</p>
  <p>And I did find some pants that&#8217;ll look good in the right size that I can order online, but I didn&#8217;t do that tonight. Instead I worked on my NixOS virtual machine for funzos. It is what it is, huh? But at any rate, not finding the pants felt like a failure, even though it really wasn&#8217;t my fault. But it made me feel lame. Maybe I should start working out?</p>
