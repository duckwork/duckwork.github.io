Yesterday, of course, was [Thanksgiving][], which is my favorite holiday.  We 
went over to a friend's house and the three of us ate only a little too much, 
drank just enough, and had a grand time watching [*March of the Wooden 
Soldiers*][movie] (the Laurel and Hardy version of *Babes in Toyland* that is 
only really creepy at the end) and an [illustrated version of "Alice's 
Restaurant][alice], playing Munchkin, and conversing.

While we were doing that last thing (and I was around my nadir of sobriety), 
Rachel and Christina (our friend) said something and it made me think 
something with such clarity I felt I had to write about it.  It was like the 
sun breaking out of clouds, was what it was like.  And I thought, I have to 
remember this so I can write it later, but I didn't write it down to remind 
myself because (1) I didn't want to be rude and (2) I really didn't want to 
move right then.  So I didn't write it down.  And of course, I forgot it.

And here we are.  What did I learn?  I really should carry a notebook around 
or write things down in my phone or something.  I shouldn't be self-conscious.  
I should *own* the thing that I am: a writer.  Maybe I'm afraid to be, or it's 
too hard, or something?  Or I'm worried about that side-eye, someone thinking, 
Who's he think he is?  Which is a form of rejection.  Which is what, I've 
decided, is the main thing I'm afraid of.  So there's that.

No cloud-breaking epiphany of self today, I'm afraid.  But there are 
leftovers.
