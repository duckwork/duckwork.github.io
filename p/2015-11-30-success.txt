So today was a roller coaster of emotion.  I began by calling my mom for help
with the rent, which embarrassed the hell out of me.  I was late to work
because I had to stop in the bathroom and cry it out a minute.  It was rough.

But then I put in a day at work.  And it got better.  And this evening I got
a job offer!  So I'll be once again gainfully employed (it's the guy I talked
about last [Tuesday][]) after finishing at the catering company.  And have
all sorts of different ways to fail!  (I can't help being jazzed.)

So there it is: bad days get better.  And my day was better even before it
got great.  There's the lesson in that.
