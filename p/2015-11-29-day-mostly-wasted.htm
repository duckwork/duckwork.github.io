  <p>Okay, today was my day off from Drake&#8217;s. I <em>should have</em> done many things, like applied to jobs or something, but I did not. Instead, I <a href="https://github.com/duckwork/dots/blob/vim_from_scratch/vimrc">rebased my vimrc</a> again, which was cool and fun but not useful. Oh, I also <a href="https://github.com/duckwork/minimal">made a new colorscheme</a> to hopefully be a little less distracting? We&#8217;ll see. I wasn&#8217;t that distracted to begin with, really.</p>
  <p>And now I&#8217;m going to bed. I have to stop doing this. Is this one of those posts that I&#8217;ll look at later and remember &#8220;Bad days happen?&#8221; All I know is that I&#8217;ve got to work on it.</p>
