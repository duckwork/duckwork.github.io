  <p>Today, I was going to write about an incident at work involving the role of women (my boss joked about domestic abuse. It was bad), and my failure to shut that shit down. And that&#8217;s really important. I don&#8217;t want to minimize that.</p>
  <p>But also: I haven&#8217;t written about much but that kind of stuff lately. Is that all the failures I have? Surely not. I don&#8217;t just have the failures-to-live-in-2015 or the failures-to-be-good-to-everyone. That&#8217;s overnobling myself by saying &#8220;In every other way, I&#8217;m perfect.&#8221; So starting tomorrow I&#8217;m going to write about some different kinds of failures.</p>
  <p>I don&#8217;t want to forget about the bullshit I see and do nothing about though. I need to do something about all of it &#8211; but it&#8217;s depressing to write about.</p>
