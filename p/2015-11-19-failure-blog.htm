  <h1>A failure blog<a href="#failure-blog" class="anchor">#</a></h1>
  <h2 class="date">11/19</h2>

  <p>Okay, so I&#8217;m not writing as much as I should in this little blog or journal or what-have-you. And I&#8217;ve been thinking about failure lately, since I attended Failure Fest (an event put on by Baton Rouge non-profit <a href="http://metromorphosis.net/">Metromorphosis</a>) in an attempt to cover it for NPR, which I think is going to also be a failure.</p>
  <p>A major theme of Failure Fest was the stigma surrounding failure, and the fact that nobody really broadcasts their failures or even talks about them except in hushed tones, which ultimately makes us feel more alone in our failures because we think we&#8217;re the only ones fucking up. But the fact is, every one fails all the time&#8212;in fact, one of the people at Failure Fest talked about how he fails every day&#8212;and we should use that failure to help each other know we&#8217;re not alone in it.</p>
  <p>So that&#8217;s been knocking around in my head since yesterday afternoon, and then today I read another article about how <a href="http://qz.com/546799/a-study-forced-people-to-quit-facebook-and-they-were-happier-for-it/">quitting Facebook makes you happier</a> because every body only posts the good stuff from their lives on there, and that makes a kind of wind-tunnel that blows us over as we read it. So that&#8217;s when I remembered a little idea I had during Failure Fest that I&#8217;m going to start today: I&#8217;m going to write a daily failure blog.</p>
  <p>Each evening, I&#8217;m going to reflect on my day and write about a failure I&#8217;ve experienced. It can be big or small, work- or personal- or whatever-related, but it&#8217;ll be a failure. I&#8217;ll write an honest appraisal of what happened, how I failed, and how I can learn or move forward tomorrow. I think it&#8217;ll be challenging, but I hope after a minute it&#8217;ll be fun. The first one is included below.</p>

  <p>Okay, so I work for a company that caters football games. We get a lot of food shipments, obviously (the stadium is one of the largest in college football), and we have these pallet jacks to cart around the pallets of food we get shipped in. We had a shipment today, and I went down to the shipping dock to help bring all the stuff in. I wondered if I should take a pallet jack with me, but they already had one down there so I figured that was enough.</p>
  <p>I get down to the ground floor and the first thing I&#8217;m asked to do is run back upstairs and get a pallet jack. Okay, there&#8217;s a small failure there&#8212;I didn&#8217;t anticipate needs. But it&#8217;s not a big deal and besides I&#8217;m not the boss and nobody knew I&#8217;d thought of it anyway, so cool. I head back up and get it and come back down. By the time I&#8217;m back down, a pallet is loaded and it&#8217;s ready to go into the elevator, so I get the pallet jack in there, jack it up, and it&#8217;s good to go.</p>
  <p>I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever seen a pallet jack, so here&#8217;s a picture: <img src="http://handtrucks2go.com/images/C/economy%20pallet2.jpg" alt="pallet jack" /> It&#8217;s steered with the handle there, which turns about 180 degrees so that the pallet can be pretty much rotated in place, which is useful but not when you&#8217;re trying to drive the damn thing. I haven&#8217;t had a lot of experience with a pallet jack so I&#8217;m struggling a little bit anyway, and I&#8217;m taking it slow because I don&#8217;t want to throw it into the middle of the elevator, I want it on the side to make more room for the other pallets that&#8217;re going in there. I&#8217;m trying to guide it in, like.</p>
  <p>The freight elevator, however, has this little gap between it and the floor (you know, so it can move between floors), and that little gap is just the right size for a wheel to get stuck in. You have to really push the pallet jack to get it over that hole and into the elevator. Because I was taking it easy, I wasn&#8217;t going fast enough and the wheel got stuck. And I couldn&#8217;t get it out.</p>
  <p>I weigh about one forty-five, one fifty pounds, and I&#8217;m not bragging about that. I&#8217;m 6&#8217;2&quot; tall, and I&#8217;m a bean pole. I have been since forever, and while it was okay to be a small kid or a skinny teenager, I&#8217;m twenty-five now and there are times I feel pretty puny, or that I&#8217;m not so &#8220;manly&#8221; as I should be (and I know that&#8217;s a whole other issue about masculinity and gender expression and all sorts of things, but it&#8217;s how I feel, so). And I&#8217;m with this cart that has about 700 pounds of meat or whatever on it. So I&#8217;m pushing and pulling and trying to rock the cart&#8217;s wheel off this little one-inch gap, and there&#8217;s a mass issue, pure and simple. I do not weigh enough to get the cart out of the gap, and another guy&#8212;a sturdier-built guy&#8212;has to come and take the cart out of the gap for me. And while in my head I know that&#8217;s a mass issue, in the moment I felt like I was not enough of a man for this job&#8212;and that, by extension, since being a &#8220;man&#8221; is a large part of my identity, I disconnected from a large part of myself in that moment. Isn&#8217;t there something, maybe in Lacan or somewhere, about that disconnect? I can&#8217;t remember.</p>
  <p>But that&#8217;s what happened&#8212;that&#8217;s my failure for today. I couldn&#8217;t get a cart out of a gap. But really, and this is only occurring to me as I write this, I maybe put too much weight in my identity in being a &#8220;man&#8221; or &#8220;manly&#8221; or what-have-you. Maybe. But I think, going forward, I&#8217;m going to try not to put so much weight on that feeling. I could work out or bulk up to fix the mass problem I had today, but I think the base issue is seeing myself in what&#8217;s ultimately an unhealthy way, even if it&#8217;s only a little unhealthy. So yeah. Day one down.</p>
