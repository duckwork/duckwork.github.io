  <p>This entry is about a more general failing that I&#8217;ve been participating in since I was born: enjoying my privilege as a white man. I&#8217;m writing now in response to Claire Vaye Watkins&#8217;s <a href="https://www.tinhouse.com/blog/41314/on-pandering.html">&#8220;On Pandering&#8221;</a>, which is (1) structured much like how I&#8217;ve been trying to structure these posts and (2) a stark reminder of how, even though I think I do a pretty good job of not being like Stephen Elliott in regards to my interactions with women, I do still write <em>for</em> and <em>toward</em> old, white men. I hold the same canon in my head as Watkins does, and it&#8217;s not okay for me either.</p>
  <p>That being said, I <em>am</em> a white man, and I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m going to get something wrong. I don&#8217;t live the experiences of women or people of color, and I don&#8217;t want to explain anyone&#8217;s lives to them. <strong>This post in itself may be a failure.</strong> Please, if you want to talk about this, tell me I&#8217;m wrong, offer suggestions, or anything, <script type="text/javascript">

  <p>Watkins&#8217;s story at the beginning of her article about Stephen Elliott&#8217;s attempts on her bed and subsequent gaslighting and dehumanizing of her is familiar to me. When I was in my undergrad at UTC, I was deeply involved with the <a href="http://meachamwriters.org/">Meacham Writers Workshop</a>, which by and large has been the greatest recurring event in my writing life. However, I remember hearing again and again about male writers attending the conference doing essentially the same thing to my female writer friends, to varying degrees. And nobody really talked about it, which is troubling especially because all of my friends were students and the visiting writers were overwhelmingly middle-aged and, I think, were trying to go for what they saw as low-hanging fruit. It felt similar to the clich&#233; of male rock stars going after groupies, and it is similar in that it&#8217;s almost expected of these men to chase, and eventually for some woman somewhere to give in. It&#8217;s a completely normalized behavior, and it&#8217;s a completely troubling behavior.</p>
  <p>What I found really interesting about the essay was Watkins&#8217;s going forward with that idea by summing up her life as &#8220;watching boys do stuff,&#8221; internalizing that structure that allows men to dismiss women and make people pander to the &#8220;old white literati,&#8221; which shuts down or disallows the stories that don&#8217;t fit into the familiar molds.</p>
  <p>And here&#8217;s the thing: this is not just a women&#8217;s issue, or a POC issue, or a marginalized issue. It is absolutely an issue for people in those groups. But it&#8217;s also an issue for people like me, just not in the #alllivesmatter #notallmen idiot ways it seems these discussions always turn into. And maybe I am being another one of those mansplainers &#8211; is saying I&#8217;m not enough not to be? is making the move away from that enough to still be able to talk about it? can I listen and speak at the same time, or give room and have room, or am I so underestimating the amount of room I have that I need to keep listening for years? &#8211; but I really don&#8217;t want to be, and I&#8217;m really trying not to be. But this is me: I&#8217;m white, I&#8217;m male, I&#8217;ve lived my whole life in what is easily a middle-class household, in the same house even, with parents who&#8217;ve stayed together and provided a supportive environment for me. Where I grew up, the most visible minority were Methodists, or at least from where I was standing&#8212;which yes, is a gross oversimplification, but is also something I said in high school. What I&#8217;m trying to say is, I live in privilege. Yes.</p>
  <p>But at the same time, (and here&#8217;s that <em>but</em>), I don&#8217;t express many of the gender markers my of my fellow east Tennessee boys and men: I don&#8217;t hunt, I don&#8217;t watch sports or follow them if I do, I do like talking about things like my feelings or whatever men aren&#8217;t supposed to talk about, I am skinny and an unabashed dork. I&#8217;m venturing into stereotype territory again, but I&#8217;ll leave with a quote from my father about me: &#8220;You&#8217;re like a city boy who lives in the country.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve felt like.</p>
  <p>So sometimes things like the <a href="https://duckwork.github.io/#failure-blog">first failure</a> I wrote about happen. And when they happen, I feel that disconnect between who I&#8217;m <em>supposed to be</em> and who I <em>am</em>, and I don&#8217;t claim that it&#8217;s the same feeling women or people of color feel every moment of every day of their lives, but maybe it&#8217;s a tiniest taste of that, and honestly that&#8217;s too much. I don&#8217;t want anyone to feel like that ever.</p>
  <p>So what is the right course of action to make sure no one does? Watkins talks about &#8220;invisible cloaks of privilege&#8221; &#8211; is it enough to make those visible and eventually remove them? How can I take the cloak off? How can I write well and not become a part of the old white literati? I think I&#8217;ve lost the original plot of this post, if I had one, if this wasn&#8217;t just a gut response to Watkins&#8217;s well-planned essay, written because I have the privilege to have gut responses. But I think Watkins shares some good ideas for moving forward:</p>
  <p><strong>Let&#8217;s punch up.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Let us not make people at the margins into scouts or spies for the mainstream. Let us stop asking people to speak for the entire cacophonic segment of humanity that shares their pigmentation, genitalia, or turn-ons.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Let us spend more time in those uncomfortable moments when our privilege is showing. Let us reflect there, let us linger, rather than recoil into the status quo.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Let us continue to count, and talk, and think about the numbers.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Let us name those things that are nameless, as Solnit describes, the way &#8220;mansplaining&#8221; or &#8220;rape culture&#8221; or &#8220;sexual harassment&#8221; were nameless before feminists named them. Let those names sing.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Let us hear the stories we are telling ourselves about ourselves. Let us remember that we become the stories we tell. An illustration: I was talking with the writer Elissa Schappell about how much we are both anticipating Carrie Brownstein&#8217;s new book. I asked Elissa what she made of this new trend of memoirs by badass women: Carrie Brownstein, Kim Gordon, Sally Mann, Amy Poehler. Was this trend the result of Patti Smith winning the National Book Award five years ago? Was the trend indicative of a new wave of feminism? Elissa interrupted me. &#8220;You keep using that word,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Trend. It&#8217;s not a trend. We are here now. We&#8217;re not going anywhere. We are here now.&#8221;</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Let us embrace a do-it-yourself canon, wherein we each make our own canon filled with what we love to read, what speaks to us and challenges us and opens us up, wherein we can each determine our artistic lineages for ourselves, with curiosity and vigor, rather than trying to shoehorn ourselves into a canon ready made and gifted us by some white fucks at Oxford.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>(I will start us off by spending no more of my living breath apologizing for the fact that no, actually, even though I write about the American West, Cormac McCarthy is not a major influence of mine.)</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Let us use our words and our gazes to make the invisible visible. Let us tell the truth.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Let us, each of us, write things that are uncategorizable, rather than something that panders to and condones and codifies those categories.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Let us burn this motherfucking system to the ground and build something better.</strong></p>
