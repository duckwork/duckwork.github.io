So we went to lunch today with some old friends of ours, and I didn't want to 
spoil my appetite, and since I didn't wake up until like nine or ten I didn't 
really eat breakfast.  However, I did drink a whole lot of coffee, which made 
me jittery and unable to concentrate during lunch (and honestly still a little 
bit now).

The reason why that's a problem is because I wasn't really able to concentrate 
on the conversation, which sucked because we hadn't seen those friends in a 
long time.  And I want to quit not being present when I'm with friends, 
especially.  We only have so much time to hang out, and it should be good 
time.  I can save the being boring or lame or unfocused for myself and family 
(though not even really them that much anymore).

Going forward, I'm going to work to be more present and active and 
compassionate in conversation, etc.  Cool beans.
