  <p>So I&#8217;ve decided to start posting these the day after, preferably in the morning, for reasons. FYI.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, I got to drive down to Kenner to cover <a href="http://www.davidvitter.com/home">David Vitter</a>&#8217;s campaign &#8220;event&#8221; (I hesitate saying &#8220;party&#8221; because (1) he didn&#8217;t win and (2) it wasn&#8217;t too festive, probably because of (1)). I generally didn&#8217;t think I did a great job but I did get a phone call from my editor this morning telling me I did do a good job, so I guess that part&#8217;s okay &#8211; mostly I was nervous and didn&#8217;t talk to literally everyone, so I thought it was a wash but I did okay. But that&#8217;s not the failure here. The failure is something that no one knew I didn&#8217;t do, except of course Rachel because I tell her everything, and now, I suppose if you&#8217;re reading this, you. (This marks the first time I&#8217;ve directly addressed a reader. Am I envisioning an audience? Does this make this something other than a diary?)</p>
  <p>My failure last night was this: after the party-slash-event ended, after every one was filtering out, after I packed up my equipment not having talked to any Republican party bigwigs, after I passed by Louisiana&#8217;s junior senator <a href="http://www.cassidy.senate.gov/">Bill Cassidy</a> saying good bye to some people, I thought that was that. But lo &#8211; Senator Cassidy and his wife were walking to their car behind me. Lo &#8211; they were never more than thirty feet from my back as I walked out into the lobby, as I walked through the parking lot. Lo &#8211; I could&#8217;ve turned around at any time and said, &#8220;Senator Cassidy, I have some questions for you&#8221; &#8211; but I didn&#8217;t do that. And that feels like a failure, even though at the time I told myself that I didn&#8217;t do it because they were done, and I didn&#8217;t want to be one of those journalists that hounds people. But I think that is, sometimes, what journalism is. I remember a phrase from the book <em>Sound Recording</em> that I still need to finish and return to the station that states I&#8217;m not there to be anyone&#8217;s friend. Which is true &#8211; I&#8217;m there to inform the public. But also I have trouble ignoring the subject&#8217;s humanity, I guess? I&#8217;m not sure, but I wasn&#8217;t quite comfortable, and I think (I pray) it was more than my new-at-this nerves.</p>
  <p>Just in case it was those nerves though, I&#8217;m adding this experience to the do-it-differently-next-time pile, and maybe I&#8217;ll start talking more to strangers. I need to get good at that.</p>
  <p><em>P.S. I just found out through writing this entry that &#8220;David Vitter&#8221; and &#8220;Bill Cassidy&#8221; have the same number of characters. Fun fact, I guess.</em></p>
