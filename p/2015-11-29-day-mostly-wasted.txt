Okay, today was my day off from Drake's.  I *should have* done many things,
like applied to jobs or something, but I did not.  Instead, I [rebased my
vimrc][vimrc] again, which was cool and fun but not useful.  Oh, I also [made
a new colorscheme][colorscheme] to hopefully be a little less distracting?
We'll see.  I wasn't that distracted to begin with, really.

And now I'm going to bed.  I have to stop doing this.  Is this one of those
posts that I'll look at later and remember "Bad days happen?"  All I know is
that I've got to work on it.
