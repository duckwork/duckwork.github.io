There's a pattern that happens a fair amount in our house:

1. Dishes pile up in the sink.
2. Rachel begins to put them in the dishwasher.
3. I (too late) try to help.
4. I sulk because I feel guilty.

Tonight, that pattern developed a slight variation.  I was able to parlay my 
way into loading the dishwasher myself after Rachel began loading it.  She 
began working on schoolwork and I was proud of myself.  I became a little too 
proud, in fact, because I remarked that it really would be best if she could 
empty out her lunch container before putting it in the sink.  What I didn't 
realize as I said it was that

1. I'd forced her out of something she was doing, not helping as I thought 
   I'd been.
2. I was then nagging her about the job I'd nagged her out of.

At the end of it all, I wasn't the good partner I thought I had been when I 
"took over" doing the dishes.  I was a bully.  So going forward, the biggest 
thing to change is being *proactive* in my side of the relationship, and 
knowing when I've been had.  She's the best in the world, and I want to keep 
up.
