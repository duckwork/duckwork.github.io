  <p>So today was a roller coaster of emotion. I began by calling my mom for help with the rent, which embarrassed the hell out of me. I was late to work because I had to stop in the bathroom and cry it out a minute. It was rough.</p>

  <p>But then I put in a day at work. And it got better. And this evening I got a job offer! So I&#8217;ll be once again gainfully employed (it&#8217;s the guy I talked about last [Tuesday][]) after finishing at the catering company. And have all sorts of different ways to fail! (I can&#8217;t help being jazzed.)</p>
  <p>So there it is: bad days get better. And my day was better even before it got great. There&#8217;s the lesson in that.</p>
