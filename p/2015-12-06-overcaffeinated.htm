  <p>So we went to lunch today with some old friends of ours, and I didn&#8217;t want to spoil my appetite, and since I didn&#8217;t wake up until like nine or ten I didn&#8217;t really eat breakfast. However, I did drink a whole lot of coffee, which made me jittery and unable to concentrate during lunch (and honestly still a little bit now).</p>
  <p>The reason why that&#8217;s a problem is because I wasn&#8217;t really able to concentrate on the conversation, which sucked because we hadn&#8217;t seen those friends in a long time. And I want to quit not being present when I&#8217;m with friends, especially. We only have so much time to hang out, and it should be good time. I can save the being boring or lame or unfocused for myself and family (though not even really them that much anymore).</p>
  <p>Going forward, I&#8217;m going to work to be more present and active and compassionate in conversation, etc. Cool beans.</p>
