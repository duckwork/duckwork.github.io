Watkins's story at the beginning of her article about Stephen Elliott's
attempts on her bed and subsequent gaslighting and dehumanizing of her is
familiar to me.  When I was in my undergrad at UTC, I was deeply involved with
the [Meacham Writers Workshop][], which by and large has been the greatest
recurring event in my writing life.  However, I remember hearing again and
again about male writers attending the conference doing essentially the same
thing to my female writer friends, to varying degrees.  And nobody really
talked about it, which is troubling especially because all of my friends were
students and the visiting writers were overwhelmingly middle-aged and, I
think, were trying to go for what they saw as low-hanging fruit.  It felt
similar to the clichÃ© of male rock stars going after groupies, and it is
similar in that it's almost expected of these men to chase, and eventually for
some woman somewhere to give in.  It's a completely normalized behavior, and
it's a completely troubling behavior.

What I found really interesting about the essay was Watkins's going forward
with that idea by summing up her life as "watching boys do stuff,"
internalizing that structure that allows men to dismiss women and make people
pander to the "old white literati," which shuts down or disallows the stories
that don't fit into the familiar molds.

And here's the thing: this is not just a women's issue, or a POC issue, or a
marginalized issue.  It is absolutely an issue for people in those groups.
But it's also an issue for people like me, just not in the #alllivesmatter
#notallmen idiot ways it seems these discussions always turn into.  And maybe
I am being another one of those mansplainers -- is saying I'm not enough not
to be? is making the move away from that enough to still be able to talk about
it? can I listen and speak at the same time, or give room and have room, or am
I so underestimating the amount of room I have that I need to keep listening
for years? -- but I really don't want to be, and I'm really trying not to be.
But this is me: I'm white, I'm male, I've lived my whole life in what is
easily a middle-class household, in the same house even, with parents who've
stayed together and provided a supportive environment for me.  Where I grew
up, the most visible minority were Methodists, or at least from where I was
standing---which yes, is a gross oversimplification, but is also something I
said in high school.  What I'm trying to say is, I live in privilege.  Yes.

But at the same time, (and here's that *but*), I don't express many of the
gender markers my of my fellow east Tennessee boys and men: I don't hunt, I
don't watch sports or follow them if I do, I do like talking about things like
my feelings or whatever men aren't supposed to talk about, I am skinny and an
unabashed dork.  I'm venturing into stereotype territory again, but I'll leave
with a quote from my father about me: "You're like a city boy who lives in the
country."  That's what I've felt like.

So sometimes things like the [first failure][] I wrote about happen.  And when
they happen, I feel that disconnect between who I'm *supposed to be* and who I
*am*, and I don't claim that it's the same feeling women or people of color
feel every moment of every day of their lives, but maybe it's a tiniest taste
of that, and honestly that's too much.  I don't want anyone to feel like that
ever.

So what is the right course of action to make sure no one does?  Watkins talks
about "invisible cloaks of privilege" -- is it enough to make those visible
and eventually remove them?  How can I take the cloak off?  How can I write
well and not become a part of the old white literati?  I think I've lost the
original plot of this post, if I had one, if this wasn't just a gut response
to Watkins's well-planned essay, written because I have the privilege to have
gut responses.  But I think Watkins shares some good ideas for moving forward:

**Let's punch up.**

**Let us not make people at the margins into scouts or spies for the
mainstream. Let us stop asking people to speak for the entire cacophonic
segment of humanity that shares their pigmentation, genitalia, or turn-ons.**

**Let us spend more time in those uncomfortable moments when our privilege is
showing. Let us reflect there, let us linger, rather than recoil into the
status quo.**

**Let us continue to count, and talk, and think about the numbers.**

**Let us name those things that are nameless, as Solnit describes, the way
"mansplaining" or "rape culture" or "sexual harassment" were nameless before
feminists named them. Let those names sing.**

**Let us hear the stories we are telling ourselves about ourselves. Let us
remember that we become the stories we tell. An illustration: I was talking
with the writer Elissa Schappell about how much we are both anticipating
Carrie Brownstein's new book. I asked Elissa what she made of this new trend
of memoirs by badass women: Carrie Brownstein, Kim Gordon, Sally Mann, Amy
Poehler. Was this trend the result of Patti Smith winning the National Book
Award five years ago? Was the trend indicative of a new wave of feminism?
Elissa interrupted me. "You keep using that word," she said. "Trend. It's not
a trend. We are here now. We're not going anywhere. We are here now."**

**Let us embrace a do-it-yourself canon, wherein we each make our own canon
filled with what we love to read, what speaks to us and challenges us and
opens us up, wherein we can each determine our artistic lineages for
ourselves, with curiosity and vigor, rather than trying to shoehorn ourselves
into a canon ready made and gifted us by some white fucks at Oxford.**

**(I will start us off by spending no more of my living breath apologizing for
the fact that no, actually, even though I write about the American West,
Cormac McCarthy is not a major influence of mine.)**

**Let us use our words and our gazes to make the invisible visible. Let us
tell the truth.**

**Let us, each of us, write things that are uncategorizable, rather than
something that panders to and condones and codifies those categories.**

**Let us burn this motherfucking system to the ground and build something
better.**
