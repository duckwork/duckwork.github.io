  <p>There&#8217;s a pattern that happens a fair amount in our house:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>Dishes pile up in the sink.</li>
  <li>Rachel begins to put them in the dishwasher.</li>
  <li>I (too late) try to help.</li>
  <li>I sulk because I feel guilty.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Tonight, that pattern developed a slight variation. I was able to parlay my way into loading the dishwasher myself after Rachel began loading it. She began working on schoolwork and I was proud of myself. I became a little too proud, in fact, because I remarked that it really would be best if she could empty out her lunch container before putting it in the sink. What I didn&#8217;t realize as I said it was that</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>I&#8217;d forced her out of something she was doing, not helping as I thought I&#8217;d been.</li>
  <li>I was then nagging her about the job I&#8217;d nagged her out of.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>At the end of it all, I wasn&#8217;t the good partner I thought I had been when I &#8220;took over&#8221; doing the dishes. I was a bully. So going forward, the biggest thing to change is being <em>proactive</em> in my side of the relationship, and knowing when I&#8217;ve been had. She&#8217;s the best in the world, and I want to keep up.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>I&#8217;ve agonized about the tone of this entry. I don&#8217;t want it to come off as &#8220;Yes, dear&#8221; mollifying or &#8220;Women, right?&#8221; dismissal &#8211; if I did, I apologize, especially to Rachel.</p>
