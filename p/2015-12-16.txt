It's been ten days since my last entry here.  I've been busy, sure, but not 
that busy.  And I have no excuse.  I changed the color scheme though!

### Anyway, an update

My new job has been going well.  I'm not doing a tontonton yet, but I'm 
picking things up and my boss likes me, so that's good.  The pacing is 
interesting---it's like a short-order kitchen for paper products.

Also Rachel is well, though today she's been working on grading which is the 
WORST and a big reason I skipped out on the whole teaching gig.  Those few 
days every six months are un-get-backable.  AND my old job had an Xmas party, 
which was a good time (too good of a time).

### But that's not the thing

The thing is from today.  The thing is a failure.

I have worn through the ass of all of my pants but two pair, and one of those 
has a big stain.  So I have one functioning pair of pants right now.  Tonight, 
I went to the Mall to get another pair of pants.

I utterly failed.  I left, two and a half hours later, pantsless.  I don't 
blame it completely on myself: I'm a 30-34 with literally 0 ass, so not a lot 
of stores carry pants that'll work on me.  I know because I checked.  Every 
store.

And I did find some pants that'll look good in the right size that I can order 
online, but I didn't do that tonight.  Instead I worked on my NixOS virtual 
machine for funzos.  It is what it is, huh?  But at any rate, not finding the 
pants felt like a failure, even though it really wasn't my fault.  But it made 
me feel lame.  Maybe I should start working out?
