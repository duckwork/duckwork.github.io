  <h1>The difficulty of appraising claims on the Internet<a href="#internet-claims" class="anchor">#</a></h1>
  <h2 class="date">10/20</h2>

  <p>I read <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com"><em>Hacker News</em></a> often, and I do what I think most people do on the site (at least given comments I&#8217;ve read) and sometimes skip to the comments before reading the article. Tonight, I did something like that: I was reading HN on my phone, just flipping through, when I found a link titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3051612/innovation-agents/media-tech-and-advertising-to-snapchat-i-aint-afraid-of-no-ghost">Understanding Snapchat&#8217;s Contradictions</a>&#8221; which I started reading and finally got bored. I flipped over to the comments.</p>
  <p>When I got <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10419828">there</a>, I found this:</p>

  <p>Obviously, it&#8217;s a spam message quoting the Bible for who knows who or why. I know this <em>because</em> when I checked again, and if you <strong>check</strong> now, you&#8217;ll see what I saw, which is that this comment is no longer there. I don&#8217;t know why the spammer chose a username like &#8220;TerryADavis,&#8221; and I don&#8217;t know why they chose the quotes they chose, and I don&#8217;t know why they thought spamming HN was a good idea &#8211; and those questions don&#8217;t really matter to me.</p>
  <p>What matters is how I thought, for a second, that this was a legitimate comment regarding the piece. It&#8217;s kind of a cousin to (I think it&#8217;s called) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law">Poe&#8217;s Law</a>, the way that it becomes impossible to tell whether a really good satire is satire or earnestness, only with spam. But in both cases, it&#8217;s not really the satirist&#8217;s or the spammer&#8217;s fault that I misinterpreted their writing. It&#8217;s mine, and the rest of this post will be about why.</p>
  <p>Like I said, I flipped to the comments way before being done with the article. It&#8217;s kind of long, and I don&#8217;t use SnapChat (or Snapchat or sNaPcHaT or however it&#8217;s capitalized), so I was like Yawn okay and went to the comments to see what people were saying about it. Which is in itself an interesting phenomenon that I think is happening with more than just me? But anyway.</p>
  <p>So I see this in the comments. It&#8217;s the only one &#8211; I guess the article is new? And I see it&#8217;s the Bible. And my little spam filter is like, Hey hold on, because I never see people quote the bible on Hacker News. But then I think, well quit being a douche and read the thing, maybe it has a good point. And because I&#8217;m thinking of Snapchat and the little bit I did read, which has something to do with communication and the paradigm of news and entertainment shifting and Snapchat, which if you don&#8217;t know isn&#8217;t just &#8220;a teen sexting app&#8221; anymore. And this quote is talking about communication &#8211; I mean, spekaing in tongues is a kind of communication, right? Like a sort of higher form of communication with or through God or &#8211; something. Again, it&#8217;s this half knowledge. But I take these two half knowledges and I throw them together and they sort of make a whole-ish knowledge, a thing I can say, Oh that makes sense, to. And then, of course, I realize, no, it&#8217;s definitely spam, there&#8217;s some clear markers like formatting and punctuation that means it&#8217;s spam, and then it&#8217;s cleared out five minutes later, so that mystery is solved.</p>
  <p>But for those few seconds, I did think this was a legitimate form of communication, of dialogue, between the ideas put forward by Snapchat and those of the apostle Paul. And so I think, maybe they are related after all. And of course they are, because they were both thought up by people, who are really basically similar over our history.</p>
  <p>As I&#8217;m writing this post, though, I realize that it&#8217;s possible the comment was made by a bot &#8211; maybe it was using a neural network to trawl the web for commentable things, saw that <em>Fast Company</em> had a post about communication &#8211; and after all, the slug has &#8220;ghost&#8221; in it, like holy ghost &#8211; and commented on the HN story. The problem is that that leads to more questions, like who put up a Bible-quoting bot to comment on message boards? Why do people make bots at all, especially if they&#8217;re not selling anything? Who&#8217;s trying to sell Christ, and who thinks the way to do it is through Internet comments? Is someone just fucking with me?</p>
  <p>I don&#8217;t have the answers to these questions. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever have them. But maybe the Internet is about questioning, and stewing in our own collective, societal juices to see what we make out of each other. A looking into our own eyes in the mirror.</p>
