So I went out with Rachel last night to watch [the game][] with my friend
from work, Steve.  Of course, since we were watching the game at a sports
bar, what actually happened is that we got drunk---and though I can't
speak for Rachel or Steve, I know that I myself did not end up caring much
about the game.  That's all well and good, but when we were headed home,
Steve mentioned he was going to drive, and I'm *that guy* who insists on
not doing that drunk (and I think there are worse guys to be).  So we
insist on Steve hopping in the Uber we called up and take him home, on the
guarantee that one of us will come to his house in the morning, pick him
up, and drive him to his car so he can go to work (I'm off today,
ostensibly for WRKF work, but really to interview for a job with a
printer---more on that maybe later, depending on how the interview goes).

Fast-forward to this morning, skipping the part where the foster shat on
the floor and we had to clean it up at something like 2:45 am, because
really that's an excuse for what happened this morning, and not a good one
either.

Fast-forward to this morning, and I feel like shit.  I'm in snooze town, as
in I've temporarily forgotten that there's a way to interact with an alarm
clock radio other than by hitting the snooze button.  So I'm not awake.  I
think you can see where this is going.

I finally wake up (with some help from Rachel, who hails (is *hails* the
right word for what you do with an Uber?) an Uber), text Steve, and we're
off.  I make light chat with the Uber driver.  She's going an interesting
way to [Walk Ons][], the aforementioned sports bar, but who am I to judge a
driver on her route?  We hit campus before she says, "Oh, the Walk Ons on
Corporate!"  So that explains the route, and we hastily correct.

About this time, Steve calls and tells me he's walking to his car because
"I'm a late guy."  We had this conversation last night, I'm remembering it
now: I'm late.  A lot.  Steve used to be late, but he can no longer stand
being late.  And because I am late this morning (and I could give excuses,
but I do not because I am A Man), he's walking to his car to go to work, I'm
sure similarly hungover, in the crisp morning air.  And he's still going to
be late.

So here's the lesson: don't be late.  Just be better at it so you don't feel
so shitty about being a late guy, Duckworth.  Lateness is tantamount to
flakiness, and that is quite the bud-sin.  So I'm going to quit being so late
all the time, and step one is to leave early.  In fact, I'm going to leave
early for that interview today.  Cool beans.
