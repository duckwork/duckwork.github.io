  <h1>On the possible nature of god</h1>
  <h2 class="date">10/25</h2>

  <p>This entry (I'm calling them <em>entries</em> now, isn't that quaint?) is precipitated by an episode of <em>The West Wing</em> in which, after the Secretary to the President dies, he talks to god and puts a cigarette out in the middle of the cathedral (which is ultra-badass, but we're not here to talk about that). FYI, I guess.</p>
  <p>So, the nature of god: the universe is entropic, meaning that it tends toward chaos. That's the second law of thermodynamics (at least as translated into modern physics, and at least as I understand it), that the entropy in a system always increases; in fact, the direction of time can be figured out by following the entropy in a system. All of this, I want to call it exposition, serves a purpose, I promise.</p>
  <p>Okay, so the universe tends toward entropy. It's a wide circling gyre of chaos. But there are these little pockets of order within that chaos -- life, for example, is a great example of that order that finds itself in a random world. And I started thinking, maybe god -- or a good definition of god -- is that force that creates these little eddies, little subsystems of order in that vast chaotic sea. It fits what I think are the important parts of the mythology of god, at least from my Christian upbringing. After all, god created life; he endowed humans with his spirit (&quot;created them in his image&quot;); he is literally the light by which we see into the darkness, according to the tradition. The light, of course, being order; the darkness chaos. (I don't have the theological background to back this up biblically, but I'm pretty sure it's a thing.)</p>
  <p>So god creates order, or god is that force which tends toward order in a chaotic universe. Let me include a diversion here. The word <em>satan</em> comes from Aramaic, and it means <em>adversary</em>. (Diversion over.) So here's my argument: the version of god in this post (sorry, <em>entry</em>), which is a version that I think I like, that I think is more accurate to my experience of the life-giving-slash-ordering force called god in the American, Christian tradition, is an adversary to the greater chaos in the world. God is a satan.</p>
  <p>No, really: it's like asking whether a zebra is white with black stripes or black with white stripes. You first must ask, &quot;What color is most of the zebra?&quot; In the same way, the universe is mostly entropic, with little eddies of space -- your body, or mine, or the things we build and maintain -- that fight against that entropy to form greater order over time. We are adversaries against chaos. And that force that we share, that allows us to stop and reverse entropy for some small amount of time -- that force that I call <em>god</em> -- is an adversary too, or literally, according to Aramaic, a satan.</p>
  <p>I should probably say more in this entry, but I'm watching another episode of <em>West Wing</em> and want to stop. So the rest is left as an exercise to the reader (Do you exist?).</p>
