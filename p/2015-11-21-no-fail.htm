  <p>I&#8217;m writing this in the morning &#8211; 9:42 in the morning, in fact &#8211; because it&#8217;s a post about my failure yesterday to write a post about failure. I&#8217;ve got to admit that I&#8217;d thought of this possibility, but thought that, at worst, it&#8217;d be an entry for when I was on vacation or something and didn&#8217;t feel like it. But I&#8217;ve used it now, only a day out of the gate, and I really don&#8217;t want to use it again. So here goes: What I Did Yesterday Evening Instead of Write About a Failure.</p>
  <p>I went to a thing in Mid City called &#8220;White Light Nights,&#8221; which was a lot of fun and artsy and winey, and then I went and bought a 32-ounce Miller High Life can, and then walked home and drank it while watching <em>West Wing</em>. It was, overall, a good night. But I forgot to do this, which means I forgot to commit to my writing, which is a failure. So here we are.</p>
  <p>I find it funny, now, that I had somewhat planned this particular failure for some future date. Like I said, I thought that I&#8217;d try to write one every day until I was out and about or on vacation or whatever and then I&#8217;d just plug a welp-I-didn&#8217;t-write-a-failblog-entry-so-that&#8217;s-how-I-failed piece in and that&#8217;d be that. No fear and no loss of face. But this is new now, and of course no failures are planned. That&#8217;s what makes them failures. So I&#8217;m reminded of that through this experience. Womp, I guess.</p>
