I'm writing this in the morning -- 9:42 in the morning, in fact -- because 
it's a post about my failure yesterday to write a post about failure.  I've 
got to admit that I'd thought of this possibility, but thought that, at worst, 
it'd be an entry for when I was on vacation or something and didn't feel like 
it.  But I've used it now, only a day out of the gate, and I really don't want 
to use it again.  So here goes: What I Did Yesterday Evening Instead of Write 
About a Failure.

I went to a thing in Mid City called "White Light Nights," which was a lot of 
fun and artsy and winey, and then I went and bought a 32-ounce Miller High 
Life can, and then walked home and drank it while watching *West Wing*.  It 
was, overall, a good night.  But I forgot to do this, which means I forgot to 
commit to my writing, which is a failure.  So here we are.

I find it funny, now, that I had somewhat planned this particular failure for 
some future date.  Like I said, I thought that I'd try to write one every day 
until I was out and about or on vacation or whatever and then I'd just plug a 
welp-I-didn't-write-a-failblog-entry-so-that's-how-I-failed piece in and 
that'd be that.  No fear and no loss of face.  But this is new now, and of 
course no failures are planned.  That's what makes them failures.  So I'm 
reminded of that through this experience.  Womp, I guess.
