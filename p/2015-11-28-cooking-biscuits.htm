  <p>Today I worked at the LSU game against Texas A &amp; M. I slung gumbo, queso, crawfish bisque, boudin, and sundry other dishes. It was a fuller game than we thought it&#8217;d be, given LSU&#8217;s recent record (they lost three straight games and were playing badly in general), and we were busy pretty much all day.<br />
  That part I&#8217;m usually fine with because I have something to do, but it tends to lead to failures. Especially this game I was at risk, because I stayed up very late last night playing a drinking game to <em>West Wing</em> with Rachel (have I mentioned this yet? or do I just talk about <em>West Wing</em> like, all the time?).</p>
  <p>In addition to all of the other stuff I slung (slang?), we had these really good Pillsbury cheddar-garlic biscuits. They were little hockey pucks of dough that were arranged in a seven-by-ten grid on a sheet tray and put in the oven at 325 for 16 minutes, with a rotation halfway through to compensate for hot spots (which our ovens have in droves). So one of those times I flipped the biscuits around and I forgot to set the timer again for when they&#8217;d be done, and they cooked a little too long and were a little crispy. Not burnt, but crispy. I lucked out, basically.</p>
  <p>I want to include this failure (which it was one, however small) because I need to remember that every day doesn&#8217;t need to have a huge fuck-up. In fact, the more days I can write about something like cooking the biscuits just a little too long, the better I&#8217;m doing in general, I think. So I want to celebrate the little failures, sort of, but still learn from them. With this one, I just have to remember to be vigilant and set that timer.</p>
