  <p>Yesterday, of course, was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franksgiving">Thanksgiving</a>, which is my favorite holiday. We went over to a friend&#8217;s house and the three of us ate only a little too much, drank just enough, and had a grand time watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024852/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3"><em>March of the Wooden Soldiers</em></a> (the Laurel and Hardy version of <em>Babes in Toyland</em> that is only really creepy at the end) and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5_8U4j51lI">illustrated version of &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Restaurant</a>, playing Munchkin, and conversing.</p>
  <p>While we were doing that last thing (and I was around my nadir of sobriety), Rachel and Christina (our friend) said something and it made me think something with such clarity I felt I had to write about it. It was like the sun breaking out of clouds, was what it was like. And I thought, I have to remember this so I can write it later, but I didn&#8217;t write it down to remind myself because (1) I didn&#8217;t want to be rude and (2) I really didn&#8217;t want to move right then. So I didn&#8217;t write it down. And of course, I forgot it.</p>
  <p>And here we are. What did I learn? I really should carry a notebook around or write things down in my phone or something. I shouldn&#8217;t be self-conscious.<br />
  I should <em>own</em> the thing that I am: a writer. Maybe I&#8217;m afraid to be, or it&#8217;s too hard, or something? Or I&#8217;m worried about that side-eye, someone thinking, Who&#8217;s he think he is? Which is a form of rejection. Which is what, I&#8217;ve decided, is the main thing I&#8217;m afraid of. So there&#8217;s that.</p>
  <p>No cloud-breaking epiphany of self today, I&#8217;m afraid. But there are leftovers.</p>
