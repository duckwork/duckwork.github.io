                <h1>The difficulty of appraising claims on the Internet.</h1>

                <p>I read <em><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker
                            News</a></em> often, and I do what I think most
                    people do on the site (at least given comments I've read)
                    and sometimes skip to the comments before reading the
                    article.  Tonight, I did something like that: I was reading
                    HN on my phone, just flipping through, when I found a link
                    titled "<a
                        href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3051612/innovation-agents/media-tech-and-advertising-to-snapchat-i-aint-afraid-of-no-ghost">Understanding
                        Snapchat's Contradictions</a>," which I started reading and finally got bored.  I flipped over to the comments.</p>

                <p>When I got <a
                        href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10419828">there</a>,
                    I found this: <blockquote> <img
                        src="i/hn-comment-screenshot.png"
                        title="Some Bible verses" /> </blockquote> Obviously,
                    it's a spam message quoting the Bible for who knows who or
                    why.  I don't know why the spammer chose a username like
                    "TerryADavis," and I don't know why they chose the quotes
                    they chose, and I don't know why they thought spamming HN
                    was a good idea -- and those questions don't really matter
                    to me.</p>

                <p>What matters is how I thought, for a second, that this was a legitimate comment regarding the piece.</p>

                <h1>About me.</h1>
                <p>A little about me: I've just moved to Baton Rouge a few
                    months ago, I'm working at the catering company for LSU
                    football games (which is quite the trip, let me tell you),
                    I'm doing an online-working thing, which is quite new to
                    me, and I'm working for the capital city's NPR station,
                    WRKF, which is what I really like.  All of these
                    ch-ch-ch-changes in my life bring me to this, which is a
                    super-lightweight blog (I don't even have styles yet!) to
                    write whatever I want.</p>
