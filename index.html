<article id="nature-of-god" class="post">
  <h1>On the possible nature of god</h1>
  <h2 class="date">10/25</h2>

  <p>This entry (I'm calling them <em>entries</em> now, isn't that quaint?) is precipitated by an episode of <em>The West Wing</em> in which, after the Secretary to the President dies, he talks to god and puts a cigarette out in the middle of the cathedral (which is ultra-badass, but we're not here to talk about that). FYI, I guess.</p>
  <p>So, the nature of god: the universe is entropic, meaning that it tends toward chaos. That's the second law of thermodynamics (at least as translated into modern physics, and at least as I understand it), that the entropy in a system always increases; in fact, the direction of time can be figured out by following the entropy in a system. All of this, I want to call it exposition, serves a purpose, I promise.</p>
  <p>Okay, so the universe tends toward entropy. It's a wide circling gyre of chaos. But there are these little pockets of order within that chaos -- life, for example, is a great example of that order that finds itself in a random world. And I started thinking, maybe god -- or a good definition of god -- is that force that creates these little eddies, little subsystems of order in that vast chaotic sea. It fits what I think are the important parts of the mythology of god, at least from my Christian upbringing. After all, god created life; he endowed humans with his spirit (&quot;created them in his image&quot;); he is literally the light by which we see into the darkness, according to the tradition. The light, of course, being order; the darkness chaos. (I don't have the theological background to back this up biblically, but I'm pretty sure it's a thing.)</p>
  <p>So god creates order, or god is that force which tends toward order in a chaotic universe. Let me include a diversion here. The word <em>satan</em> comes from Aramaic, and it means <em>adversary</em>. (Diversion over.) So here's my argument: the version of god in this post (sorry, <em>entry</em>), which is a version that I think I like, that I think is more accurate to my experience of the life-giving-slash-ordering force called god in the American, Christian tradition, is an adversary to the greater chaos in the world. God is a satan.</p>
  <p>No, really: it's like asking whether a zebra is white with black stripes or black with white stripes. You first must ask, &quot;What color is most of the zebra?&quot; In the same way, the universe is mostly entropic, with little eddies of space -- your body, or mine, or the things we build and maintain -- that fight against that entropy to form greater order over time. We are adversaries against chaos. And that force that we share, that allows us to stop and reverse entropy for some small amount of time -- that force that I call <em>god</em> -- is an adversary too, or literally, according to Aramaic, a satan.</p>
  <p>I should probably say more in this entry, but I'm watching another episode of <em>West Wing</em> and want to stop. So the rest is left as an exercise to the reader (Do you exist?).</p>

<article id="internet-claims" class="post">
  <h1>The difficulty of appraising claims on the Internet</h1>
  <h2 class="date">10/20</h2>

  <p>I read <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com"><em>Hacker News</em></a> often, and I do what I think most people do on the site (at least given comments I've read) and sometimes skip to the comments before reading the article. Tonight, I did something like that: I was reading HN on my phone, just flipping through, when I found a link titled &quot;<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3051612/innovation-agents/media-tech-and-advertising-to-snapchat-i-aint-afraid-of-no-ghost">Understanding Snapchat's Contradictions</a>&quot; which I started reading and finally got bored. I flipped over to the comments.</p>
  <p>When I got <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10419828">there</a>, I found this:</p>
  <figure>
  <img src="i/hn-comment-screenshot.png" alt="Some bible verses" /><figcaption>Some bible verses</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Obviously, it's a spam message quoting the Bible for who knows who or why. I know this because when I checked again, and if you check now, you'll see what I saw, which is that this comment is no longer there. I don't know why the spammer chose a username like &quot;TerryADavis,&quot; and I don't know why they chose the quotes they chose, and I don't know why they thought spamming HN was a good idea -- and those questions don't really matter to me.</p>
  <p>What matters is how I thought, for a second, that this was a legitimate comment regarding the piece. It's kind of a cousin to (I think it's called) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law">Poe's Law</a>, the way that it becomes impossible to tell whether a really good satire is satire or earnestness, only with spam. But in both cases, it's not really the satirist's or the spammer's fault that I misinterpreted their writing. It's mine, and the rest of this post will be about why.</p>
  <p>Like I said, I flipped to the comments way before being done with the article. It's kind of long, and I don't use SnapChat (or Snapchat or sNaPcHaT or however it's capitalized), so I was like Yawn okay and went to the comments to see what people were saying about it. Which is in itself an interesting phenomenon that I think is happening with more than just me? But anyway.</p>
  <p>So I see this in the comments. It's the only one -- I guess the article is new? And I see it's the Bible. And my little spam filter is like, Hey hold on, because I never see people quote the bible on Hacker News. But then I think, well quit being a douche and read the thing, maybe it has a good point. And because I'm thinking of Snapchat and the little bit I did read, which has something to do with communication and the paradigm of news and entertainment shifting and Snapchat, which if you don't know isn't just &quot;a teen sexting app&quot; anymore. And this quote is talking about communication -- I mean, spekaing in tongues is a kind of communication, right? Like a sort of higher form of communication with or through God or -- something. Again, it's this half knowledge. But I take these two half knowledges and I throw them together and they sort of make a whole-ish knowledge, a thing I can say, Oh that makes sense, to. And then, of course, I realize, no, it's definitely spam, there's some clear markers like formatting and punctuation that means it's spam, and then it's cleared out five minutes later, so that mystery is solved.</p>
  <p>But for those few seconds, I did think this was a legitimate form of communication, of dialogue, between the ideas put forward by Snapchat and those of the apostle Paul. And so I think, maybe they are related after all. And of course they are, because they were both thought up by people, who are really basically similar over our history.</p>
  <p>As I'm writing this post, though, I realize that it's possible the comment was made by a bot -- maybe it was using a neural network to trawl the web for commentable things, saw that <em>Fast Company</em> had a post about communication -- and after all, the slug has &quot;ghost&quot; in it, like holy ghost -- and commented on the HN story. The problem is that that leads to more questions, like who put up a Bible-quoting bot to comment on message boards? Why do people make bots at all, especially if they're not selling anything? Who's trying to sell Christ, and who thinks the way to do it is through Internet comments? Is someone just fucking with me?</p>
  <p>I don't have the answers to these questions. I don't think I'll ever have them. But maybe the Internet is about questioning, and stewing in our own collective, societal juices to see what we make out of each other. A looking into our own eyes in the mirror.</p>

            <h1>About me</h1>

            <p>A little about me: I've just moved to Baton Rouge a few months
                ago, I'm working at the catering company for LSU football games
                (which is quite the trip, let me tell you), I'm doing an
                online-working thing, which is quite new to me, and I'm working
                for the capital city's NPR station, WRKF, which is what I
                really like.  All of these ch-ch-ch-changes in my life bring me
                to this, which is a super-lightweight blog (I don't even have
                styles yet!) to write whatever I want.</p>

            <p>If you don't like it, you can leave, or comment on the site by
                sending me an <a href="mailto:casedizz@gmail.com" title="I
                    swear to god, if you spam me, I will go Liam Neeson on your
