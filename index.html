  <h1>On lateness, even when hungover<a href="#hungover-lateness" class="anchor">#</a></h1>
  <h2 class="date">11/24</h2>

  <blockquote>
  <p>This didn&#8217;t technically happen <em>yesterday</em>, but I&#8217;m playing fast and loose with the timing because it&#8217;s the failure I&#8217;m right now reckoning with most. I feel like that&#8217;s more important than following my own rules anyway.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So I went out with Rachel last night to watch [the game][] with my friend from work, Steve. Of course, since we were watching the game at a sports bar, what actually happened is that we got drunk&#8212;and though I can&#8217;t speak for Rachel or Steve, I know that I myself did not end up caring much about the game. That&#8217;s all well and good, but when we were headed home, Steve mentioned he was going to drive, and I&#8217;m <em>that guy</em> who insists on not doing that drunk (and I think there are worse guys to be). So we insist on Steve hopping in the Uber we called up and take him home, on the guarantee that one of us will come to his house in the morning, pick him up, and drive him to his car so he can go to work (I&#8217;m off today, ostensibly for WRKF work, but really to interview for a job with a printer&#8212;more on that maybe later, depending on how the interview goes).</p>
  <p>Fast-forward to this morning, skipping the part where the foster shat on the floor and we had to clean it up at something like 2:45 am, because really that&#8217;s an excuse for what happened this morning, and not a good one either.</p>
  <p>Fast-forward to this morning, and I feel like shit. I&#8217;m in snooze town, as in I&#8217;ve temporarily forgotten that there&#8217;s a way to interact with an alarm clock radio other than by hitting the snooze button. So I&#8217;m not awake. I think you can see where this is going.</p>
  <p>I finally wake up (with some help from Rachel, who hails (is <em>hails</em> the right word for what you do with an Uber?) an Uber), text Steve, and we&#8217;re off. I make light chat with the Uber driver. She&#8217;s going an interesting way to [Walk Ons][], the aforementioned sports bar, but who am I to judge a driver on her route? We hit campus before she says, &#8220;Oh, the Walk Ons on Corporate!&#8221; So that explains the route, and we hastily correct.</p>
  <p>About this time, Steve calls and tells me he&#8217;s walking to his car because &#8220;I&#8217;m a late guy.&#8221; We had this conversation last night, I&#8217;m remembering it now: I&#8217;m late. A lot. Steve used to be late, but he can no longer stand being late. And because I am late this morning (and I could give excuses, but I do not because I am A Man), he&#8217;s walking to his car to go to work, I&#8217;m sure similarly hungover, in the crisp morning air. And he&#8217;s still going to be late.</p>
  <p>So here&#8217;s the lesson: don&#8217;t be late. Just be better at it so you don&#8217;t feel so shitty about being a late guy, Duckworth. Lateness is tantamount to flakiness, and that is quite the bud-sin. So I&#8217;m going to quit being so late all the time, and step one is to leave early. In fact, I&#8217;m going to leave early for that interview today. Cool beans.</p>

  <h1>Missing the connection<a href="#missed-connection" class="anchor">#</a></h1>
  <h2 class="date">11/22</h2>

  <p>(So I&#8217;ve decided to start posting these the day after, preferably in the morning, for reasons. FYI.)</p>
  <p>Yesterday, I got to drive down to Kenner to cover <a href="http://www.davidvitter.com/home">David Vitter</a>&#8217;s campaign &#8220;event&#8221; (I hesitate saying &#8220;party&#8221; because (1) he didn&#8217;t win and (2) it wasn&#8217;t too festive, probably because of (1)). I generally didn&#8217;t think I did a great job but I did get a phone call from my editor this morning telling me I did do a good job, so I guess that part&#8217;s okay &#8211; mostly I was nervous and didn&#8217;t talk to literally everyone, so I thought it was a wash but I did okay. But that&#8217;s not the failure here. The failure is something that no one knew I didn&#8217;t do, except of course Rachel because I tell her everything, and now, I suppose if you&#8217;re reading this, you. (This marks the first time I&#8217;ve directly addressed a reader. Am I envisioning an audience? Does this make this something other than a diary?)</p>
  <p>My failure last night was this: after the party-slash-event ended, after every one was filtering out, after I packed up my equipment not having talked to any Republican party bigwigs, after I passed by Louisiana&#8217;s junior senator <a href="http://www.cassidy.senate.gov/">Bill Cassidy</a> saying good bye to some people, I thought that was that. But lo &#8211; Senator Cassidy and his wife were walking to their car behind me. Lo &#8211; they were never more than thirty feet from my back as I walked out into the lobby, as I walked through the parking lot. Lo &#8211; I could&#8217;ve turned around at any time and said, &#8220;Senator Cassidy, I have some questions for you&#8221; &#8211; but I didn&#8217;t do that. And that feels like a failure, even though at the time I told myself that I didn&#8217;t do it because they were done, and I didn&#8217;t want to be one of those journalists that hounds people. But I think that is, sometimes, what journalism is. I remember a phrase from the book <em>Sound Recording</em> that I still need to finish and return to the station that states I&#8217;m not there to be anyone&#8217;s friend. Which is true &#8211; I&#8217;m there to inform the public. But also I have trouble ignoring the subject&#8217;s humanity, I guess? I&#8217;m not sure, but I wasn&#8217;t quite comfortable, and I think (I pray) it was more than my new-at-this nerves.</p>
  <p>Just in case it was those nerves though, I&#8217;m adding this experience to the do-it-differently-next-time pile, and maybe I&#8217;ll start talking more to strangers. I need to get good at that.</p>
  <p><em>P.S. I just found out through writing this entry that &#8220;David Vitter&#8221; and &#8220;Bill Cassidy&#8221; have the same number of characters. Fun fact, I guess.</em></p>

<article id="no-fail" class="post">
  <h1>No failures are planned, I guess<a href="#no-fail" class="anchor">#</a></h1>
  <h2 class="date">11-21</h2>

  <p>I&#8217;m writing this in the morning &#8211; 9:42 in the morning, in fact &#8211; because it&#8217;s a post about my failure yesterday to write a post about failure. I&#8217;ve got to admit that I&#8217;d thought of this possibility, but thought that, at worst, it&#8217;d be an entry for when I was on vacation or something and didn&#8217;t feel like it. But I&#8217;ve used it now, only a day out of the gate, and I really don&#8217;t want to use it again. So here goes: What I Did Yesterday Evening Instead of Write About a Failure.</p>
  <p>I went to a thing in Mid City called &#8220;White Light Nights,&#8221; which was a lot of fun and artsy and winey, and then I went and bought a 32-ounce Miller High Life can, and then walked home and drank it while watching <em>West Wing</em>. It was, overall, a good night. But I forgot to do this, which means I forgot to commit to my writing, which is a failure. So here we are.</p>
  <p>I find it funny, now, that I had somewhat planned this particular failure for some future date. Like I said, I thought that I&#8217;d try to write one every day until I was out and about or on vacation or whatever and then I&#8217;d just plug a welp-I-didn&#8217;t-write-a-failblog-entry-so-that&#8217;s-how-I-failed piece in and that&#8217;d be that. No fear and no loss of face. But this is new now, and of course no failures are planned. That&#8217;s what makes them failures. So I&#8217;m reminded of that through this experience. Womp, I guess.</p>

<article id="failure-blog" class="post">
  <h1>A failure blog<a href="#failure-blog" class="anchor">#</a></h1>
  <h2 class="date">11/19</h2>

  <p>Okay, so I&#8217;m not writing as much as I should in this little blog or journal or what-have-you. And I&#8217;ve been thinking about failure lately, since I attended Failure Fest (an event put on by Baton Rouge non-profit <a href="http://metromorphosis.net/">Metromorphosis</a>) in an attempt to cover it for NPR, which I think is going to also be a failure.</p>
  <p>A major theme of Failure Fest was the stigma surrounding failure, and the fact that nobody really broadcasts their failures or even talks about them except in hushed tones, which ultimately makes us feel more alone in our failures because we think we&#8217;re the only ones fucking up. But the fact is, every one fails all the time&#8212;in fact, one of the people at Failure Fest talked about how he fails every day&#8212;and we should use that failure to help each other know we&#8217;re not alone in it.</p>
  <p>So that&#8217;s been knocking around in my head since yesterday afternoon, and then today I read another article about how <a href="http://qz.com/546799/a-study-forced-people-to-quit-facebook-and-they-were-happier-for-it/">quitting Facebook makes you happier</a> because every body only posts the good stuff from their lives on there, and that makes a kind of wind-tunnel that blows us over as we read it. So that&#8217;s when I remembered a little idea I had during Failure Fest that I&#8217;m going to start today: I&#8217;m going to write a daily failure blog.</p>
  <p>Each evening, I&#8217;m going to reflect on my day and write about a failure I&#8217;ve experienced. It can be big or small, work- or personal- or whatever-related, but it&#8217;ll be a failure. I&#8217;ll write an honest appraisal of what happened, how I failed, and how I can learn or move forward tomorrow. I think it&#8217;ll be challenging, but I hope after a minute it&#8217;ll be fun. The first one is included below.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Okay, so I work for a company that caters football games. We get a lot of food shipments, obviously (the stadium is one of the largest in college football), and we have these pallet jacks to cart around the pallets of food we get shipped in. We had a shipment today, and I went down to the shipping dock to help bring all the stuff in. I wondered if I should take a pallet jack with me, but they already had one down there so I figured that was enough.</p>
  <p>I get down to the ground floor and the first thing I&#8217;m asked to do is run back upstairs and get a pallet jack. Okay, there&#8217;s a small failure there&#8212;I didn&#8217;t anticipate needs. But it&#8217;s not a big deal and besides I&#8217;m not the boss and nobody knew I&#8217;d thought of it anyway, so cool. I head back up and get it and come back down. By the time I&#8217;m back down, a pallet is loaded and it&#8217;s ready to go into the elevator, so I get the pallet jack in there, jack it up, and it&#8217;s good to go.</p>
  <p>I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever seen a pallet jack, so here&#8217;s a picture: <img src="http://handtrucks2go.com/images/C/economy%20pallet2.jpg" alt="pallet jack" /> It&#8217;s steered with the handle there, which turns about 180 degrees so that the pallet can be pretty much rotated in place, which is useful but not when you&#8217;re trying to drive the damn thing. I haven&#8217;t had a lot of experience with a pallet jack so I&#8217;m struggling a little bit anyway, and I&#8217;m taking it slow because I don&#8217;t want to throw it into the middle of the elevator, I want it on the side to make more room for the other pallets that&#8217;re going in there. I&#8217;m trying to guide it in, like.</p>
  <p>The freight elevator, however, has this little gap between it and the floor (you know, so it can move between floors), and that little gap is just the right size for a wheel to get stuck in. You have to really push the pallet jack to get it over that hole and into the elevator. Because I was taking it easy, I wasn&#8217;t going fast enough and the wheel got stuck. And I couldn&#8217;t get it out.</p>
  <p>I weigh about one forty-five, one fifty pounds, and I&#8217;m not bragging about that. I&#8217;m 6&#8217;2&quot; tall, and I&#8217;m a bean pole. I have been since forever, and while it was okay to be a small kid or a skinny teenager, I&#8217;m twenty-five now and there are times I feel pretty puny, or that I&#8217;m not so &#8220;manly&#8221; as I should be (and I know that&#8217;s a whole other issue about masculinity and gender expression and all sorts of things, but it&#8217;s how I feel, so). And I&#8217;m with this cart that has about 700 pounds of meat or whatever on it. So I&#8217;m pushing and pulling and trying to rock the cart&#8217;s wheel off this little one-inch gap, and there&#8217;s a mass issue, pure and simple. I do not weigh enough to get the cart out of the gap, and another guy&#8212;a sturdier-built guy&#8212;has to come and take the cart out of the gap for me. And while in my head I know that&#8217;s a mass issue, in the moment I felt like I was not enough of a man for this job&#8212;and that, by extension, since being a &#8220;man&#8221; is a large part of my identity, I disconnected from a large part of myself in that moment. Isn&#8217;t there something, maybe in Lacan or somewhere, about that disconnect? I can&#8217;t remember.</p>
  <p>But that&#8217;s what happened&#8212;that&#8217;s my failure for today. I couldn&#8217;t get a cart out of a gap. But really, and this is only occurring to me as I write this, I maybe put too much weight in my identity in being a &#8220;man&#8221; or &#8220;manly&#8221; or what-have-you. Maybe. But I think, going forward, I&#8217;m going to try not to put so much weight on that feeling. I could work out or bulk up to fix the mass problem I had today, but I think the base issue is seeing myself in what&#8217;s ultimately an unhealthy way, even if it&#8217;s only a little unhealthy. So yeah. Day one down.</p>

<article id="nature-of-god" class="post">
  <h1>On the possible nature of god<a href="#nature-of-god" class="anchor">#</a></h1>
  <h2 class="date">10/25</h2>

  <p>This entry (I&#8217;m calling them <em>entries</em> now, isn&#8217;t that quaint?) is precipitated by an episode of <em>The West Wing</em> in which, after the Secretary to the President dies, he talks to god and puts a cigarette out in the middle of the cathedral (which is ultra-badass, but we&#8217;re not here to talk about that). FYI, I guess.</p>
  <p>So, the nature of god: the universe is entropic, meaning that it tends toward chaos. That&#8217;s the second law of thermodynamics (at least as translated into modern physics, and at least as I understand it), that the entropy in a system always increases; in fact, the direction of time can be figured out by following the entropy in a system. All of this, I want to call it exposition, serves a purpose, I promise.</p>
  <p>Okay, so the universe tends toward entropy. It&#8217;s a wide circling gyre of chaos. But there are these little pockets of order within that chaos &#8211; life, for example, is a great example of that order that finds itself in a random world. And I started thinking, maybe god &#8211; or a good definition of god &#8211; is that force that creates these little eddies, little subsystems of order in that vast chaotic sea. It fits what I think are the important parts of the mythology of god, at least from my Christian upbringing. After all, god created life; he endowed humans with his spirit (&#8220;created them in his image&#8221;); he is literally the light by which we see into the darkness, according to the tradition. The light, of course, being order; the darkness chaos. (I don&#8217;t have the theological background to back this up biblically, but I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s a thing.)</p>
  <p>So god creates order, or god is that force which tends toward order in a chaotic universe. Let me include a diversion here. The word <em>satan</em> comes from Aramaic, and it means <em>adversary</em>. (Diversion over.) So here&#8217;s my argument: the version of god in this post (sorry, <em>entry</em>), which is a version that I think I like, that I think is more accurate to my experience of the life-giving-slash-ordering force called god in the American, Christian tradition, is an adversary to the greater chaos in the world. God is a satan.</p>
  <p>No, really: it&#8217;s like asking whether a zebra is white with black stripes or black with white stripes. You first must ask, &#8220;What color is most of the zebra?&#8221; In the same way, the universe is mostly entropic, with little eddies of space &#8211; your body, or mine, or the things we build and maintain &#8211; that fight against that entropy to form greater order over time. We are adversaries against chaos. And that force that we share, that allows us to stop and reverse entropy for some small amount of time &#8211; that force that I call <em>god</em> &#8211; is an adversary too, or literally, according to Aramaic, a satan.</p>
  <p>I should probably say more in this entry, but I&#8217;m watching another episode of <em>West Wing</em> and want to stop. So the rest is left as an exercise to the reader (Do you exist?).</p>

<article id="internet-claims" class="post">
  <h1>The difficulty of appraising claims on the Internet<a href="#internet-claims" class="anchor">#</a></h1>
  <h2 class="date">10/20</h2>

  <p>I read <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com"><em>Hacker News</em></a> often, and I do what I think most people do on the site (at least given comments I&#8217;ve read) and sometimes skip to the comments before reading the article. Tonight, I did something like that: I was reading HN on my phone, just flipping through, when I found a link titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3051612/innovation-agents/media-tech-and-advertising-to-snapchat-i-aint-afraid-of-no-ghost">Understanding Snapchat&#8217;s Contradictions</a>&#8221; which I started reading and finally got bored. I flipped over to the comments.</p>
  <p>When I got <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10419828">there</a>, I found this:</p>
  <figure>
  <img src="i/hn-comment-screenshot.png" alt="Some bible verses" /><figcaption>Some bible verses</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Obviously, it&#8217;s a spam message quoting the Bible for who knows who or why. I know this because when I checked again, and if you check now, you&#8217;ll see what I saw, which is that this comment is no longer there. I don&#8217;t know why the spammer chose a username like &#8220;TerryADavis,&#8221; and I don&#8217;t know why they chose the quotes they chose, and I don&#8217;t know why they thought spamming HN was a good idea &#8211; and those questions don&#8217;t really matter to me.</p>
  <p>What matters is how I thought, for a second, that this was a legitimate comment regarding the piece. It&#8217;s kind of a cousin to (I think it&#8217;s called) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law">Poe&#8217;s Law</a>, the way that it becomes impossible to tell whether a really good satire is satire or earnestness, only with spam. But in both cases, it&#8217;s not really the satirist&#8217;s or the spammer&#8217;s fault that I misinterpreted their writing. It&#8217;s mine, and the rest of this post will be about why.</p>
  <p>Like I said, I flipped to the comments way before being done with the article. It&#8217;s kind of long, and I don&#8217;t use SnapChat (or Snapchat or sNaPcHaT or however it&#8217;s capitalized), so I was like Yawn okay and went to the comments to see what people were saying about it. Which is in itself an interesting phenomenon that I think is happening with more than just me? But anyway.</p>
  <p>So I see this in the comments. It&#8217;s the only one &#8211; I guess the article is new? And I see it&#8217;s the Bible. And my little spam filter is like, Hey hold on, because I never see people quote the bible on Hacker News. But then I think, well quit being a douche and read the thing, maybe it has a good point. And because I&#8217;m thinking of Snapchat and the little bit I did read, which has something to do with communication and the paradigm of news and entertainment shifting and Snapchat, which if you don&#8217;t know isn&#8217;t just &#8220;a teen sexting app&#8221; anymore. And this quote is talking about communication &#8211; I mean, spekaing in tongues is a kind of communication, right? Like a sort of higher form of communication with or through God or &#8211; something. Again, it&#8217;s this half knowledge. But I take these two half knowledges and I throw them together and they sort of make a whole-ish knowledge, a thing I can say, Oh that makes sense, to. And then, of course, I realize, no, it&#8217;s definitely spam, there&#8217;s some clear markers like formatting and punctuation that means it&#8217;s spam, and then it&#8217;s cleared out five minutes later, so that mystery is solved.</p>
  <p>But for those few seconds, I did think this was a legitimate form of communication, of dialogue, between the ideas put forward by Snapchat and those of the apostle Paul. And so I think, maybe they are related after all. And of course they are, because they were both thought up by people, who are really basically similar over our history.</p>
  <p>As I&#8217;m writing this post, though, I realize that it&#8217;s possible the comment was made by a bot &#8211; maybe it was using a neural network to trawl the web for commentable things, saw that <em>Fast Company</em> had a post about communication &#8211; and after all, the slug has &#8220;ghost&#8221; in it, like holy ghost &#8211; and commented on the HN story. The problem is that that leads to more questions, like who put up a Bible-quoting bot to comment on message boards? Why do people make bots at all, especially if they&#8217;re not selling anything? Who&#8217;s trying to sell Christ, and who thinks the way to do it is through Internet comments? Is someone just fucking with me?</p>
  <p>I don&#8217;t have the answers to these questions. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever have them. But maybe the Internet is about questioning, and stewing in our own collective, societal juices to see what we make out of each other. A looking into our own eyes in the mirror.</p>
