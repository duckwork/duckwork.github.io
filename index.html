                <p>A little about me: I've just moved to Baton Rouge a few
                    months ago, I'm working at the catering company for LSU
                    football games (which is quite the trip, let me tell you),
                    I'm doing an online-working thing, which is quite new to
                    me, and I'm working for the capital city's NPR station,
                    WRKF, which is what I really like.  All of these
                    ch-ch-ch-changes in my life bring me to this, which is a
                    super-lightweight blog (I don't even have styles yet!) to
                    write whatever I want.</p>
