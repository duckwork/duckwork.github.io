                <p>I read <em><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker
                            News</a></em> often, and I do what I think most
                    people do on the site (at least given comments I've read)
                    and sometimes skip to the comments before reading the
                    article.  Tonight, I did something like that: I was reading
                    HN on my phone, just flipping through, when I found a link
                    titled "<a
                        href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3051612/innovation-agents/media-tech-and-advertising-to-snapchat-i-aint-afraid-of-no-ghost">Understanding
                        Snapchat's Contradictions</a>," which I started reading and finally got bored.  I flipped over to the comments.</p>

                <p>When I got <a
                        href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10419828">there</a>,
                    I found this: <blockquote> <img
                        src="i/hn-comment-screenshot.png" title="Some Bible
                        verses" /> </blockquote> Obviously, it's a spam message
                    quoting the Bible for who knows who or why.  I know this
                    because when I checked again, and if you check now, you'll
                    see what I saw, which is that this comment is no longer
                    there.  I don't know why the spammer chose a username like
                    "TerryADavis," and I don't know why they chose the quotes
                    they chose, and I don't know why they thought spamming HN
                    was a good idea -- and those questions don't really matter
                    to me.</p>

                <p>What matters is how I thought, for a second, that this was a
                    legitimate comment regarding the piece.  It's kind of a
                    cousin to [I think it's called] <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law">Poe's
                        Law</a>, the way that it becomes impossible to tell
                    whether a really good satire is satire or earnestness, only
                    with spam.  But in both cases, it's not really the
                    satirist's or the spammer's fault that I misinterpreted
                    their writing.  It's mine, and the rest of this post will
                    be about why.</p>

                <p>Like I said, I flipped to the comments way before being done
                    with the article.  It's kind of long, and I don't use
                    SnapChat (or Snapchat or sNaPcHaT or however it's
                    capitalized), so I was like Yawn okay and went to the
                    comments to see what people were saying about it.  Which is
                    in itself an interesting phenomenon that I think is
                    happening with more than just me?  But anyway.</p>

                <p>So I see this in the comments.  It's the only one -- I guess
                    the article is new?  And I see it's the Bible.  And my
                    little spam filter is like, Hey hold on, because I never
                    see people quote the bible on Hacker News.  But then I
                    think, well quit being a douche and read the thing, maybe
                    it has a good point.  And because I'm thinking of Snapchat
                    and the little bit I did read, which has something to do
                    with communication and the paradigm of news and
                    entertainment shifting and Snapchat, which if you don't
                    know isn't just "a teen sexting app" anymore.  And this
                    quote is talking about communication -- I mean, spekaing in
                    tongues is a kind of communication, right?  Like a sort of
                    higher form of communication with or through God or --
                    something.  Again, it's this half knowledge.  But I take
                    these two half knowledges and I throw them together and
                    they sort of make a whole-ish knowledge, a thing I can say,
                    Oh that makes sense, to.  And then, of course, I realize,
                    no, it's definitely spam, there's some clear markers like
                    formatting and punctuation that means it's spam, and then
                    it's cleared out five minutes later, so that mystery is
                    solved.</p>

                <p>But for those few seconds, I did think this was a legitimate
                    form of communication, of dialogue, between the ideas put
                    forward by Snapchat and those of the apostle Paul.  And so
                    I think, maybe they are related after all.  And of course
                    they are, because they were both thought up by people, who
                    are really basically similar over our history.</p>

                <p>As I'm writing this post, though, I realize that it's
                    possible the comment was made by a bot -- maybe it was
                    using a neural network to trawl the web for commentable
                    things, saw that <em>Fast Company</em> had a post about
                    communication -- and after all, the slug has "ghost" in it,
                    like holy ghost -- and commented on the HN story.  The
                    problem is that that leads to more questions, like who put
                    up a Bible-quoting bot to comment on message boards?  Why
                    do people make bots at all, especially if they're not
                    selling anything?  Who's trying to sell Christ, and who
                    thinks the way to do it is through Internet comments?  Is
                    someone just fucking with me?</p>

                <p>I don't have the answers to these questions.  I don't think
                    I'll ever have them.  But maybe the Internet is about
                    questioning, and stewing in our own collective, societal
                    juices to see what we make out of each other.  A looking
                    into our own eyes in the mirror.</p>

            <h1>About me</h1>

            <p>A little about me: I've just moved to Baton Rouge a few months
                ago, I'm working at the catering company for LSU football games
                (which is quite the trip, let me tell you), I'm doing an
                online-working thing, which is quite new to me, and I'm working
                for the capital city's NPR station, WRKF, which is what I
                really like.  All of these ch-ch-ch-changes in my life bring me
                to this, which is a super-lightweight blog (I don't even have
                styles yet!) to write whatever I want.</p>
