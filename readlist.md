A big reason I started this site again is to keep track of books I want to
read.  I work at a library now, and I've just learned how to order books
directly to my desk at work, so this past week I went a little crazy with
requesting multiple books and them all showing up on my desk at once.  Now,
I'm a fairly quick reader, but I'm not so fast that I can read 5 or 6 books in
three weeks, plus I don't want to unduly burden my coworkers who have to find
all these books and send them to me and check them out to me.  So I'm
maintaining this list of books that I'm thinking about reading so that when I
finish a book, I'll just look here to pick a new one.

Another thing I want to do is to review books as I read them, so when I read
a book on this list, I'll linkify it to a blog post about the book itself.
Later, I might move the book to another list on this page to make the *Unread*
and *Read* lists neater or easier to navigate, but I'll cross that bridge when
I come to it.  For now, it'll just be a big list of books with some notes if I
grabbed a whole list from a website or something.

One last rule: some of the books from these best-of lists I've already read.
The rule is as follows: if it's there, I'll read it again.  I'm an inveterate
read-oncer,[^1] but I really think that should change.  Reading books more
than once allows them to open up and reveal their deeper meanings.

[^1]: Is this the correct usage of inveterate?  The world may never know.

# My old readlist

*So if you peer into the history of this site, you'll see I had an old
readlist too, mostly pulled from my Amazon wishlist.  Why?  Because Amazon is
evil, I said, and I still believe that.  I don't like how much they've taken
over, and since R worked in publishing, she has front-line horror stories
about Amazon.  So I'm not going to support them, not even through a wishlist.
It's right here.*
