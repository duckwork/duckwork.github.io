# Duckwork blog: a README

`duckwork.github.io` is, as of now, my blog.  At this very moment, it's a blog 
chronicling my failures each day, either large or small.  I'm thinking about 
adding some navigational elements a la [Benedict Evans' site][], but that'll 
come later (this weekend or holiday season?!).  At any rate, all opinions 
expressed within are my own, and don't reflect on any one else.  It's mostly 
diary, but it's public, so if you've found it, dear reader, hello.

## Colophon

I write each post in [ViM][] and use [pandoc][] with a Makefile wrapped in a 
publishing shell script.  If you're reading this README, you're in the Github 
repo, so you can see everything I'm using to push posts to the web.
