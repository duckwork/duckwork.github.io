Today I worked at the LSU game against Texas A & M.  I slung gumbo, queso, 
crawfish bisque, boudin, and sundry other dishes.  It was a fuller game than 
we thought it'd be, given LSU's recent record (they lost three straight games 
and were playing badly in general), and we were busy pretty much all day.  
That part I'm usually fine with because I have something to do, but it tends 
to lead to failures.  Especially this game I was at risk, because I stayed up 
very late last night playing a drinking game to *West Wing* with Rachel (have 
I mentioned this yet? or do I just talk about *West Wing* like, all the 
time?).

In addition to all of the other stuff I slung (slang?), we had these really 
good Pillsbury cheddar-garlic biscuits.  They were little hockey pucks of 
dough that were arranged in a seven-by-ten grid on a sheet tray and put in the 
oven at 325 for 16 minutes, with a rotation halfway through to compensate for 
hot spots (which our ovens have in droves).  So one of those times I flipped 
the biscuits around and I forgot to set the timer again for when they'd be 
done, and they cooked a little too long and were a little crispy.  Not burnt, 
but crispy.  I lucked out, basically.

I want to include this failure (which it was one, however small) because I 
need to remember that every day doesn't need to have a huge fuck-up.  In fact, 
the more days I can write about something like cooking the biscuits just a 
little too long, the better I'm doing in general, I think.  So I want to 
celebrate the little failures, sort of, but still learn from them.  With this 
one, I just have to remember to be vigilant and set that timer.
